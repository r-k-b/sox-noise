plays some "white" noise

# usage

```shell
$ playdeep
```

or

```shell
$ playpink
```

# issues

the pinned nixpkgs version has some problem; workaround is to run `nix-shell ./shell.nix` directly

What's the best way to switch the pinned nixpkgs version? For example, if we 
wanted to pin it to the same commit as the 21.03 release?

# future work

add those scripts as Flake Outputs, so they can be run directly from github?
